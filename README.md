[Interactive codon wheel](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rkquillen/hs_bio_resources/blob/main/codon_wheel/codonWheel.html)
- Tool for teaching high school students to map mRNA triplets (codons) to corresponding amino acids
- Use the following keys to operate the codon wheel
  - [a,c,g,u] - select next nucleotide
  - [backspace] - delete
  - [enter] - save codon and continue
  - [esc] - reset 

[Central dogma practice](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rkquillen/hs_bio_resources/blob/main/central_dogma/centralDogma.html)
- Interactive answer key generator for transcription and translation 
- Includes DNA template strand, mRNA, codons, amino acids, and 5'/3' labels
- Notes: 
  - Codons are not displayed until a start codon (mRNA = "AUG", DNA = "TAC") is detected
  - Codons following a stop codon (e.g., "UGA") are ignored
- Instructions:
  - [mouse click] on "DNA" or "mRNA" to select input row 
  - [a,c,g,t,u] - add nucleotide to selected row 
  - [backspace] - remove previous nucleotide from row
  - [esc] - reset all rows
- Example: 
  - click on "DNA"
  - type: AATAC ACCCC AACTT
